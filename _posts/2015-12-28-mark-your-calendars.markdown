# Mark Your Calendars

Remember that calendar of cats doing yoga poses that your great aunt got you last week? Go ahead, open it up, and draw a little T-Rex on **Friday, June 24, 2016.** We're going to have a conference.

You're more than welcome—nay, _encouraged_—to go ahead and share the news with your friends and loved ones. In order to make it easier for you, we made [this incredible link that you can click on to create a tweet announcing the good news](https://twitter.com/home?status=I%20just%20found%20out%20that%20%40dinosaur_js%20is%20going%20to%20be%20on%20Friday,%20June%2024,%202016%20in%20Denver,%20Colorado!%20http%3A//dinosaurjs.org/).

## What Even Is This?

Dinosaur.js is a not-for-profit, community-driven JavaScript conference in Denver, Colorado. The format is one day with a single track.

## What's in a Name?

So, why is it even called Dinosaur.js? Good question. [Dinosaur Ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_Ridge) is just outside of Denver. It's where the Apatosaurus, Diplodocus, Stegosaurus, and Allosaurus (née Brontosaurus) were first found. There are also a bunch of Iguanadon footprints there too. I'll repeat this, because it bears repeating: this is where the Stegosaurus lived.

## More to Come

We'll be sending out information announcing early bird tickets, our call for proposals, our master/mistress of ceremonies, and confirmed speakers to the [mailing list][ml]. The [mailing list][ml] is going to be the first place to hear about these exciting developments.

You should sign up if you haven't. If someone in your life that you feel should know about any of the above, please encourage them to [sign up for this very important newsletter][ml].

## How to Help

As we mentioned above, this is a community-driven conference and we'd love your support.

### I'm Interested in Sponsoring

That's great! We're interested in having sponsors. We're putting the finishing touches on our sponsor prospectus, but please let us know that you're interested [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DFnIAaB8-fNkWu7SKu1MjA8yPp0lQ68DWWwH2SeXwUQ/viewform) and Jessica or Steve will definitely follow-up with you as soon as possible.

### I'm Interested in Volunteering

Righteous. We're going to need your help as the event gets closer—especially since this a community-driven event and you're the community. That said, it's still early days and we don't exactly know what we need yet. We'd super appreciate it if you registered your interest in helping [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bT9xAWLV2VaieGMEBgwck1mGYkiZ-bZLgXT4nL5vR64/viewform) and we'll reach out to you when the time comes.
