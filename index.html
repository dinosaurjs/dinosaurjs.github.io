<p>So, why is it even called Dinosaur.js? Good question. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_Ridge">Dinosaur Ridge</a> is just outside of Denver. It&#8217;s where the Apatosaurus, Diplodocus, Stegosaurus, and Allosaurus (née Brontosaurus) were first found. There are also a bunch of Iguanadon footprints there too. I&#8217;ll repeat this, because it bears repeating: this is where the Stegosaurus lived.</p>
